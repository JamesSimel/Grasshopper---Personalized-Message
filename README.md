# Grasshopper - Personalized Message

Create a function that gives a personalized greeting. This function takes two parameters: name and owner.

Use conditionals to return the proper message:

|case | return|
| ---- | --- |
| name equals owner |	'Hello boss' |
| otherwise | 'Hello guest' |

##This is the code I used and I am sure there are many other.
```
    const greet = (name, owner) => {
        return name === owner? "Hello boss":"Hello guest"
    }

```
